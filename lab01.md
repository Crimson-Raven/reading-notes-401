### How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?
SOC 2 compliance is a security standard that can benefit your company by strengthening security, increasing customer trust, and giving you a competitive advantage. While there are initial costs, the long-term benefits outweigh them. You can convince your company to pursue compliance by highlighting these benefits, addressing concerns about cost and time, and offering solutions like a phased approach.

### What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?
Security: Guards information from unauthorized access or harm.
Availability: Ensures authorized users can access data when needed.
Processing Integrity: Guarantees data is accurate and processed correctly.
Confidentiality: Keeps customer data private.
Privacy: Follows regulations for how customer data is handled.

### How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
The three SOC2 levels are like building a data security pyramid:
Level 1 (Brochure Report): The base, outlining security policies - essential but basic.
Level 2 (Auditor's Report): Adds a layer, with an independent review to ensure practices match policies, making it more trustworthy.
Level 3 (Trust Services Criteria): The top, most secure level, going beyond controls to address industry-specific risks.
Choose the SOC 2 level that best reflects your commitment to data security, building a strong pyramid of trust.
