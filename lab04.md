### What are three benefits of following CIS Benchmarks?
CIS Benchmarks offer a three-fold benefit: stronger security defenses, easier compliance, and industry-backed best practices.

### What are the seven core categories of CIS Benchmarks?
CIS Benchmarks offer security configuration guides across seven key areas: operating systems, desktop applications, mobile devices (if applicable), server software, network devices, cloud platforms, and even device firmware.

### How would you convince your manager that applying CIS Benchmarks could fast-track your organizationâ€™s compliance?
You can convince your manager that CIS Benchmarks speed up compliance by:
Highlighting time saved: CIS Benchmarks provide a ready-made guide, eliminating the need to build compliance from scratch.
Demonstrating easier audits: CIS Benchmarks align with regulations, making audits smoother and potentially cheaper.
Addressing concerns: Acknowledge resource needs and propose phased implementation or focusing on critical systems first.
Presenting a plan: Suggest a pilot program and showcase your willingness to champion the initiative.
