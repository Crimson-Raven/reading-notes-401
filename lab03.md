### Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
The CIA triad refers to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which are essential principles for securing any system, including an ATM. Here's how an ATM can incorporate measures to address each principle:
Confidentiality: Encrypted PINs, one-way hashing, and secure data transmission shield your PIN and account details.
Integrity: Data validation, transaction verification, and checksums ensure information accuracy during transactions.
Availability: Backups, maintenance, and UPS systems minimize downtime and keep your access reliable.

### Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
Three pillars for strong security (CIA triad):
Lock it tight: Use encryption to scramble data, keeping it confidential.
Limit access: Give users only what they need (least privilege), protecting data integrity.
Stay updated and prepared: Back up data and update systems regularly to ensure availability and prevent breaches.

### What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stageâ€™s main goal or objective?
Spot the threats: Identify and assess potential risks, considering how likely they are and how bad they could be.
Plan the defense: Develop strategies to deal with the risks, like reducing their impact, sharing the burden, or avoiding them altogether.
Stay vigilant: Continuously monitor the risks and how well your plans are working, making adjustments as needed.
